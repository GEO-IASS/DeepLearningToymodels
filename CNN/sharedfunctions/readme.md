## Files explained

**Only the 5 files below are needed to run ```CNNtoymodel.m```**

not_needed just contains other functions like tanh etc.  
I just added them as starting point to improve the model (without actually testing them).  

### Forward Pass
maxpool.m  is max pooling (downsampling)  
relu.m is the activation function 
### Backward Pass
maxpoolup.m is the reverse max pooling operation (upsampling)  
reluup.m is the reverse relu operation

###classification
softmax.m calculates the Softmax Probabilities, the Cross Entropy Loss, and the Output Delta
